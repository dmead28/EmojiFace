# EmojiFace
Beginnings of my final project for Computational Photography. Still experimenting with a framework that will detect faces and emotions. Will use keypoints and emotion data to superimpose and transform the respective emoji to a person's face (possibly multiple faces) in real time. Continuation from EmojiFaceOLD (which was an Objective-C project)

This is a Swift project with Objective-C++ code to interact with OpenCV. It also uses the Affdex framework for emotion detection.
